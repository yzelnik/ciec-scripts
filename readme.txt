This folder shows how the figures (and related calculations) for the manuscript "How collectively integrated are ecological communities?" were done using Matlab.

The scripts to directly use are: PrepCommunities.m, MakeFigures.m, Complexity.m
The first script file creates many communities and calculations which the second file uses to produce Figs.2-5 in the paper. The third script file creates some communities to demonstrate how Fig.6 was done.

You should open each of the three script files separately, and run it in several steps, by clicking each section (shown in yellow) and using Ctrl+Enter to run each section consecutively.

The other Matlab files in the folder are used by the 3 main script files.
